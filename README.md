# Machine Learning with Python: Logistic Regression

Welcome to my personal project repository on Logistic Regression using Python! This collection features my hands-on work with logistic regression models, complete with code snippets, practical examples, and interpretations.


Are you passionate about using machine learning to tackle real-world problems? In this project, I dive into logistic regression, a supervised machine learning approach that models selected values to predict possible outcomes. Here, I provide a step-by-step guide on building a logistic regression model using Python, along with tips for collecting, exploring, and transforming data before even getting started. By the end of exploring this repository, you'll understand how to design, build, evaluate, and manage logistic regression models effectively.

## Project Structure

Python Scripts: This folder contains Python code files that are used with Interactive windows. Here, you'll find the implementation of logistic regression models and various data processing techniques.

Data: This folder includes the datasets used for the projects. Feel free to explore the data and try out the scripts.

All the detailed interpretations and explanations of the code will be presented in the form of blog posts on Medium. Check out my Medium profile for in-depth discussions and insights.
